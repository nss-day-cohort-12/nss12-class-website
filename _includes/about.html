        <h2>We are Cohort 12, and we are ready for your coding challenges!</h2>
        <p>Innovation, communication, and determination. These are the traits of an NSS graduate.
          [Insert short description of NSS program here.] 
            We are Cohort 12 of the Nashville Software School and we come from ​a variety of different backgrounds and disciplines. [Maybe some sort of transition is needed? Like how does this part apply to us being able to solve coding problems?]
            So rejoice! After hours of sleepless nights, and buckets of caffeine we are ready for YOUR coding challenges, Nashville. Get to know each ​of us below.</p>
